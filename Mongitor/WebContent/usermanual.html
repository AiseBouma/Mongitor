<h2>Introduction</h2>
This manual will explain every window in detail, but will focus on the subjects which are not straightforward.

<h2>Checking the cluster the first time</h2>
The first check will take much longer than subsequent checks. This is because Mongitor has to establish a connection to each
server in the cluster. These connections are preserved for as long as Mongitor runs, so subsequent checks are much faster.
